# kattis-problems
Hello! Here I share my mostly Java-based solutions to Kattis problems. 

These are meant for own version control between computers, but also to share with my fellow colleagues at the IT University of Copenhagen.
Some of the solutions are inspired by solutions to assignments I've had in courses, others are from theory read somewhere on the internet. 

Feel free to draw inspiration from these, onto your own (better..!) solutions.
Some solutions aren't quite finished nor accepted, so I can't promise glorious points on Kattis.
